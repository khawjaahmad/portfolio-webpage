  **Design Movement**: Brutalist Minimalism
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Raw & Direct**: Unapologetic use of large typography and high contrast.
  2.  **Function over Form**: Elements are stripped down to their essentials, but arranged with precision.
  3.  **Monochromatic Depth**: Using shades of black and dark gray to create hierarchy without relying on color.
  4.  **Grid-Breaking**: Elements overlap and ignore traditional boundaries to create tension.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  -   **Background**: Deep Black (#050505) - To create an infinite, immersive void.
  -   **Text**: Stark White (#FFFFFF) & Dark Gray (#333333) - For maximum readability and subtle background text.
  -   **Accent**: Electric Red (#FF3333) - Used sparingly for interactive elements to draw the eye immediately.
  -   *Reasoning*: The high contrast evokes a sense of seriousness and professional confidence, mirroring the "dark mode" aesthetic of modern developer tools.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  -   **Asymmetric Split**: The screen is divided not by a center line, but by the weight of the content.
  -   **Sticky Navigation**: A vertical sidebar or floating elements that persist, grounding the user.
  -   **Overlapping Layers**: Text elements (like the large "01") sit behind the content but in front of the background, creating depth.

  **Signature Elements**:
  -   **Giant Watermark Numbers**: Massive, dark gray numbers (01, 02) that serve as both navigation markers and background texture.
  -   **Line Decors**: Thin, vertical lines that guide the eye and separate sections without heavy borders.
  -   **Mouse Follower**: A subtle custom cursor or follower that highlights interactive areas.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  -   **Hover-Reveal**: Information expands or highlights when hovered.
  -   **Smooth Scroll**: A buttery smooth scrolling experience that feels heavy and deliberate.
  -   **Micro-Glitches**: Subtle text glitches on hover to add a tech-forward feel.

  **Animation**:
  -   **Entrance**: Elements slide in from the void with a staggered delay.
  -   **Scroll**: Parallax effects where the background numbers move slower than the foreground text.
  -   **Hover**: Text color shifts instantly, no fade.

  **Typography System**:
  -   **Display**: 'Oswald' or 'Teko' - Tall, condensed, and bold for headlines and the giant numbers.
  -   **Body**: 'Roboto Mono' or 'Space Mono' - Monospaced font for descriptions to emphasize the technical/developer aspect.

  **Design Movement**: Cinematic Noir
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Atmospheric Lighting**: Using gradients and shadows to mimic studio lighting.
  2.  **Storytelling Focus**: The layout guides the user through a narrative about the person.
  3.  **Elegant & Moody**: A sophisticated, polished look that feels like a high-end magazine.
  4.  **Fluidity**: Everything moves like liquid, seamless transitions.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  -   **Background**: Rich Charcoal (#121212) to Soft Black gradient.
  -   **Text**: Off-White (#E0E0E0) for warmth, avoiding the harshness of pure white.
  -   **Accent**: Muted Gold (#C5A059) or Deep Teal (#004D40) - For a touch of luxury.
  -   *Reasoning*: To elevate the portfolio from a simple resume to a personal brand statement.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  -   **Rule of Thirds**: Placing the subject (image) and key text at intersection points.
  -   **Whitespace Framing**: Using negative space to frame the content like a photograph.
  -   **Z-Pattern**: Guiding the eye from the logo to the nav, across to the image, and back to the text.

  **Signature Elements**:
  -   **Spotlight Effect**: A subtle radial gradient behind the subject image.
  -   **Elegant Serifs**: Using a serif font for headings to contrast with the modern layout.
  -   **Glassmorphism**: Subtle frosted glass effects on navigation or cards.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  -   **Slow Reveal**: Content fades in gently as you scroll.
  -   **Magnetic Buttons**: Buttons that slightly pull towards the cursor.
  -   **Parallax Image**: The profile image moves slightly with the mouse position.

  **Animation**:
  -   **Fade & Scale**: Elements gently scale up and fade in.
  -   **Image Reveal**: A mask reveal for the profile image.
  -   **Text Stagger**: Lines of text appear one after another.

  **Typography System**:
  -   **Display**: 'Playfair Display' - Elegant, high-contrast serif.
  -   **Body**: 'Lato' or 'Montserrat' - Clean, geometric sans-serif for readability.

  **Design Movement**: Cyber-Industrial
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Modular Construction**: The interface looks like a dashboard or a HUD (Heads-Up Display).
  2.  **Data Visualization**: Using bars, lines, and code snippets as decorative elements.
  3.  **High Tech**: A feeling of precision engineering and futuristic utility.
  4.  **Structured Chaos**: Many small details that come together to form a cohesive whole.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  -   **Background**: Gunmetal (#1A1A1A) and Slate.
  -   **Text**: Terminal Green (#00FF41) or Cyan (#00FFFF) for highlights against gray text.
  -   **Accent**: Safety Orange (#FF5722) - For critical actions.
  -   *Reasoning*: To appeal to a tech-savvy audience and showcase technical proficiency.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  -   **Grid System**: Visible grid lines or corner markers defining the space.
  -   **Sidebar Navigation**: A persistent vertical bar with icons and status indicators.
  -   **Card-Based**: Content is contained within defined rectangular areas.

  **Signature Elements**:
  -   **Corner Brackets**: framing key content areas.
  -   **Monospace Everything**: Or at least for all UI elements (nav, buttons, labels).
  -   **Scanlines**: A very subtle overlay texture.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  -   **Instant Feedback**: Hover states are snappy and immediate.
  -   **Sound Design**: (Optional) Subtle clicks or beeps on interaction.
  -   **Typing Effect**: Text appears as if it's being typed out.

  **Animation**:
  -   **Glitch Transitions**: Scene changes involve a digital distortion effect.
  -   **Slide & Snap**: Elements slide into place and "lock" with a bounce.
  -   **Cursor Trail**: A digital trail following the mouse.

  **Typography System**:
  -   **Display**: 'Rajdhani' - Squared, technical look.
  -   **Body**: 'Fira Code' or 'JetBrains Mono' - Developer-friendly fonts.
